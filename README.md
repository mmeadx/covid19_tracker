**Intent**

_This project aims to use data from [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/data/api) and display graphics that show the impact of the COVID-19 virus in the United States._

_This project was orginally created for a University of Minnesota Bootcamp project. Because we're using data from an API source, we wanted to create a new project that does not rely on an database (as the project required)._
